            "location": "The kids loved the pool which was warmer than the ones at the resort in Cancun which we could not believe as we were in Seattle! We flew into SEA TAC for a few days before our cruise and our travel agent recommended this hotel. Downtown Seattle was about a 30 minute ride by light rail service (cost of $16 for the 4 of us) or $40 cab ride to the pier.",
            "service": "The staff was friendly and we appreciated the cookies after a long flight when we were waiting to check inn. I think it is fair to mention it costs to use internet in your room but for business travlers I suppose that is an expected cost. Shuttle was convenient and would definitely stay here again.",
