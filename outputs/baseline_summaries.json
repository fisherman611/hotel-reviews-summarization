It had easy access to the light rail located at the airport (we took the DT shuttle over), and was next to an Enterprise car rental. Lots of conveniences close by.",
            "service": "Late check in was effortless and was greeted with a warmed cookie. Shuttle was convenient and would definitely stay here again. I think it is fair to mention it costs to use internet in your room but for business travlers I suppose that is an expected cost.",
