            "rooms": "Rooms were ready well in advance and received good rates from the affiliate travel booking platform. While not all aspects of the experience were satisfactory, overall the hotel provided a comfortable stay with adequate amenities and service.",
            "location": "The hotel was clean, comfortable, and within walking distance of major attractions, including the airport, restaurants, and entertainment options. However, it was further away from downtown Seattle, making travel more time-consuming and expensive compared to other hotels in the area. Guests appreciated the convenience of having easy access to public transportation, but found the proximity to the airport less appealing due to its high cost. Overall, while the location offered some advantages, it did not outweigh the drawbacks mentioned in the positive reviews.",
            "service": "Overall, the hotel provided a comfortable and convenient stay, with good cleanliness, location advantages, and friendly staff. However, some guests found the late check-in process challenging due to its inconvenience. Additionally, the cost of using the internet was mentioned as an expectation for business travelers, which may not be acceptable to all guests.",
