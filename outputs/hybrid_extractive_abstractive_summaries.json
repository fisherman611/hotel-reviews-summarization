            "rooms": "The room was ready for us early in the morning, which was a pleasant surprise. The staff was friendly and attentive, and the room rate was excellent. However, some guests found the noise from other rooms disruptive, especially during peak hours when the hotel is busy. Overall, the experience was satisfactory but could have been improved by considering more privacy options.",
