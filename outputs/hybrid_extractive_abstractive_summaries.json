The bathrooms are mixed, some need cleaner doors and to be renovated, others seem clean and well appointed. The ice and vending machines are close. The coffee machine in the room is appreciated. The lighting was insufficient, and an old basement smell was present sometimes.",
                "While close to the airport, it was quiet because of thick windows. The beds were large and comfortable with lots of extra pillows. The bathrooms could use some refurbishment.

Some things that need work is the bad lighting, unkempt bathrooms and smell of mildew. All that being said, the rooms are very quiet even though the hotel is close to the airport."
